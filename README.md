#GIT: Git Isn't Tough
###A workshop on version control and social coding
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system developed by [Linus Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) to be used for the Linux kernel development. It quickly grew to be one of the most widely used source code management systems.

This is an interactive workshop where you learn about git and the workflow behind it, and how to use version control in a professional and collaborative setting. This repository will host code samples and documentation used in the workshop.

###Pre-Workshop Preparation
The workshop is designed to be interactive and encourages the audience to actively participate in the discussion. To make sure you hit the ground running, you are encouraged before coming to the event to:

  1. [Download & Install Git](docs/git-setup.md)
  1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup/free) account.
